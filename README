This script retrieves company id of a requested company from LinkedIn.

I did not want to register an App in LinkedIn, my desire was to scrape this data from LinkedIn website directly.

Company Id can be seen by inspecting the source of company webpage, as seen here - https://stackoverflow.com/a/53963679

What I am doing in the script is I am fetching the website using selenium and going over the source. I visit each /company/company_id link in the source, and when I encounter the desired company I return the id from the URL.
